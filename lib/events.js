/**
 * Emits an event just like the standard EventEmitter does, however, if the
 * last parameter passed is a function, it is assumed to be a callback that
 * will be called once the event has propagated to all listeners or it has
 * been canceled due to an error.
 *
 * Note that this module also permits listeners to be executed asynchronously.
 * Any asynchronous listeners will be notified of an event in order of
 * registration. Each listener will block the next listener to receive the
 * event until the callback that is passed to it is called. If an error is
 * passed as the first parameter to the callback, then the event will be
 * canceled.
 *
 * Backwards-compatibility support exists for the deprecated method of passing
 * the first argument as an object with a 'type' property that indicates the
 * event type.
 *
 * So two forms are available:
 * * The standard emit() usage of an event type and an arbitrary number of
 *   arguments.
 * * DEPRECATED: A single event object argument with the following fields:
 *     type: event type (string)
 *     time: event time (Date, optional, added if omitted)
 *     details: event details (object)
 *
 * @return a Promise that resolves to undefined once the event has been emitted
 *         to all listeners (or to `false` if it was canceled).
